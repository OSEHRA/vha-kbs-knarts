    <chapter>
        <title>General Process</title>
        <para>In integrating and harmonizing the individual components of a composite knowledge
            artifact (KNART), the general process has been to rely on the inherent encapsulation
            properties envisioned in the new composite structure. Each individual knowledge artifact
            is presumed to be able to run in a stand-alone and independent manner. The composite
            artifact acts as a central orchestration agent, activating individual knowledge
            artifacts using an event-driven model. Intercommunication between artifacts is handled
            solely through global shared state external to the composite and through the process of
            event payloads. Individual KNARTs only communicate with the composite container.</para>
        <para>During the creation of the individual KNARTs used in the formation of the composite,
            their design and implementation explicitly envisioned their further integration into a
            composite structure. As such, minimal harmonization or communication is generally
            required. All composite KNARTs use references to the individual component knowledge
            artifacts rather than direct inclusion. The general design principles used should ensure
            that the overall composite does not alter the essential information contained in the
            components.</para>
        <para>The emerging composite KNART standard envisions that the parent composite will not
            restate the metadata included in its component parts unless there is a clinical or
            technical need to override or supplement the information contained in the components.
            This includes elements such as supporting evidence, intended use, etc. Analysis of the
            components of this KNART did not find the need to make any overrides or supplements to
            the essential metadata.</para>
        <para>In developing the Version 2.0 KNART standard, the work group has updated the essential
            file structure to support composites. The design approach of the workgroup was to define
            the composite mechanism to support composition that includes both literal inclusion and
            references to other KNARTs. The emerging standard explicitly envisions that composites
            may be of a heterogeneous nature and supports artifacts authoring in other forms. The
            creation of the Version 2 schema explicitly maintains backward compatibility. The
            Version 1 knowledge document schema was structured such that the introduction of
            composite feature could not be made without breaking backward compatibility. As a
            result, internal organization of the schema was refactored to isolate the concept of a
            knowledge document and create two potential root references, which could be used
            depending on whether the KNART was a singleton or a composite. The Version 2 schema
            supports the composite structures, references, and direct inclusion of multiple
            knowledge documents. All the elements of the original document type are still
            supported.</para>

            <title>Overview of Integration Scenario</title>
            <para>This composite uses an integration scenario whereby an Event-Condition-Action
                (ECA) rule is first used to screen whether a consult is required and which order
                sets are needed. If the screening is indicated (see the section โClinical Statement
                Indicating Screening Should Occurโ), then the documentation template is projected
                and requested order sets are then activated. All orchestration is accomplished
                through embedded ECA rules in the composite.</para>

            <para>The composite KNART is a machine-readable artifact comprised of independently
                validated components. The goal of the composition is not to add additional content
                but rather to orchestrate the individual components. The composite is not expected
                to be machine executable. The schema and functional environment in which the

                compatible with the final balloted standard.</para>

                <title>Format Limitation</title>
                <para>The proposed Health Level Seven International (HL7) KNART format for
                    composites is based on the original Knowledge Artifact Specification (KAS)
                    schema. The composite extension is specifically developed to allow the
                    composition of these singleton KAS artifacts into an organizing structure to
                    provide greater meaning. The composite KNART format is an emerging standard at
                    HL7 that allows heterogeneous artifacts to be grouped into one common organizing
                    document. In creating the composite knowledge artifacts, the individual
                    components of the composite have been limited to the existing KAS-derived
                    artifact types. As such, the abstraction of more advanced orchestration behavior
                    has been limited to the capabilities of that model.</para>
