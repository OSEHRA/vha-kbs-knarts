    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The VA is committed to improving the ability of clinicians to
    provide care for patients while increasing quality, safety, and
    efficiency. Recognizing the importance of standardizing clinical knowledge
    in support of this goal, VA is implementing the Health Level 7 (<acronym><glossterm>HL7</glossterm></acronym>) Knowledge Artifact Specification for a wide range of VA
    clinical use cases. Knowledge Artifacts, referred to as (<acronym><glossterm>KNARTs</glossterm></acronym>), enable the structuring and encoding of clinical knowledge
    so the knowledge can be integrated with electronic health records to
    enable clinical decision support.</para>

    <para>The purpose of this Clinical Content White Paper (<acronym><glossterm>CCWP</glossterm></acronym>) is to capture the clinical context and intent of <acronym><glossterm>KNART</glossterm></acronym> use cases in sufficient detail to provide the <acronym><glossterm>KNART</glossterm></acronym> authoring team with the clinical source material to construct
    the corresponding knowledge artifacts using the <acronym><glossterm>HL7</glossterm></acronym> Knowledge Artifact Specification. This paper has been
    developed using material from a variety of sources: VA artifacts, clinical
    practice guidelines, evidence in the body of medical literature, and
    clinical expertise. After reviewing these sources, the material has been
    synthesized and harmonized under the guidance of VA subject matter experts
    to reflect clinical intent for this use case.</para>

    <para>Unless otherwise noted, items within this white paper (e.g.,
    documentation template fields, orderable items, etc.) are chosen to
    reflect the clinical intent at the time of creation. To provide an
    exhaustive list of all possible items and their variations is beyond the
    scope of this work.</para>

    <title>Primary Care: Tobacco Assessment and Cessation Counseling</title>

    <section>
      <title>Clinical Context</title>

      <para>[Begin Clinical Context.]</para>

      <para>Tobacco use continues to be one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease
        in the U.S., accounting for approximately 480,000 deaths each year (U.S. Department of
        Health and Human Services 2014). It is incumbent upon clinicians to adhere to evidence-based
        practices in assisting patients who use tobacco to quit.</para>

      <para>This knowledge artifact is intended to support the clinical provider's evaluation of
        tobacco use, counseling regarding tobacco cessation, and documentation of findings and
        clinical decisions from the evaluation and counseling process. The screening and counseling
        questions for the template are drawn from the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information
        Set (<acronym><glossterm>HEDIS</glossterm></acronym>), a tool published by the National
        Committee for Quality Assessment (<acronym><glossterm>NCQA</glossterm></acronym>) and used
        by more than 90 percent of America's health plans to measure performance on important
        dimensions of care and service (<link
          xlink:href="https://www.ncqa.org/report-cards/health-plans/state-of-health-care-quality/2016-table-of-contents/smoking-cessation"
          >NCQA HEDIS 2018</link>). </para>

      <para>While the <acronym><glossterm>HEDIS</glossterm></acronym> tobacco measure is based on patient responses on a survey,
      the Veterans Health Administration (<acronym><glossterm>VHA</glossterm></acronym>) HEDIS-based national performance measure relies on
      documentation of once-a-year screening and counseling and documentation
      by primary care health care professionals. Work is currently underway to
      develop a national electronic clinical reminder to support the <acronym><glossterm>VHA</glossterm></acronym> HEDIS-based tobacco measure. </para>

      <para>[Clinical Comment: <acronym><glossterm>VHA</glossterm></acronym> Tobacco Assessment
        Screening is based on the <acronym><glossterm>HEDIS</glossterm></acronym> survey measure
          <emphasis>Medical Assistance With Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation</emphasis>, which
        consists of multiple component measures to assess rates of medical assistance for tobacco
        cessation (NCQA HEDIS 2018). Components of the measure include: </para>
