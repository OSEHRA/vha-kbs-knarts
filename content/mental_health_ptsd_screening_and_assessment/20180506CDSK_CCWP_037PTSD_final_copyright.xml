    <para><?xxe-sn 1uf77u7y1a8 lcmt4oo6lkcd?>The VA is committed to improving
    the ability of clinicians to provide care for patients while increasing
    quality, safety, and efficiency. Recognizing the importance of
    standardizing clinical knowledge in support of this goal, VA is
    implementing the Health Level 7 (HL7) Knowledge Artifact Specification for
    a wide range of VA clinical use cases. Knowledge Artifacts, referred to as
    (KNARTs), enable the structuring and encoding of clinical knowledge so the
    knowledge can be integrated with electronic health records to enable
    clinical decision support.</para>

    <para><?xxe-sn 1uf77u7y1a8 lcmt4oo6lkce?>The purpose of this Clinical
    Content White Paper (CCWP) is to capture the clinical context and intent
    of KNART use cases in sufficient detail to provide the KNART authoring
    team with the clinical source material to construct the corresponding
    knowledge artifacts using the HL7 Knowledge Artifact Specification. This
    paper has been developed using material from a variety of sources: VA
    artifacts, clinical practice guidelines, evidence in the body of medical
    literature, and clinical expertise. After reviewing these sources, the
    material has been synthesized and harmonized under the guidance of VA
    subject matter experts to reflect clinical intent for this use
    case.</para>

    <para><?xxe-sn 1uf77u7y1a8 lcmt4oo6lkcf?>Unless otherwise noted, items
    within this white paper (e.g., documentation template fields, orderable
    items, etc.) are chosen to reflect the clinical intent at the time of
    creation. To provide an exhaustive list of all possible items and their
    variations is beyond the scope of this work.</para>

      traumatic events in which they were personally or indirectly exposed to
      death, injury, or sexual violence. Reactions to such exposures may

      PTSD is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The diagnostic criteria for PTSD
      include eight individual criteria, one of which requires that symptoms
      must have persisted for at least one month. DSM-5 also identifies that
      diagnosis may be rendered even when full diagnostic criteria (all 8
      criteria) are not met until six months or more after the trauma(s),
      although onset of some symptoms may occur immediately ("Delayed
