    <chapter>
        <title>General Process</title>
        <para>In integrating and harmonizing the individual components of a composite knowledge
            artifact (KNART), the general process has been to rely on the inherent encapsulation
            properties envisioned in the new composite structure. Each individual knowledge artifact
            is presumed to be able to run in a stand-alone and independent manner. The composite
            artifact acts as a central orchestration agent, activating individual knowledge
            artifacts using an event-driven model. Intercommunication between artifacts is handled
            solely through global shared state external to the composite and through the process of
            event payloads. Individual KNARTs only communicate with the composite container.</para>
        <para>During the creation of the individual KNARTs used in the formation of the composite,
            their design and implementation explicitly envisioned their further integration into a
            composite structure. As such, minimal harmonization or communication is generally
            required. All composite KNARTs use references to the individual component knowledge
            artifacts rather than direct inclusion. The general design principles used should ensure
            that the overall composite does not alter the essential information contained in the
            components.</para>
        <para>The emerging composite KNART standard envisions that the parent composite will not
            restate the metadata included in its component parts unless there is a clinical or
            technical need to override or supplement the information contained in the components.
            This includes elements such as supporting evidence, intended use, etc. Analysis of the
            components of this KNART did not find the need to make any overrides or supplements to
            the essential metadata.</para>
        <para>In developing the Version 2.0 KNART standard, the work group has updated the essential
            file structure to support composites. The design approach of the workgroup was to define
            the composite mechanism to support composition that includes both literal inclusion and
            references to other KNARTs. The emerging standard explicitly envisions that composites
            may be of a heterogeneous nature and supports artifacts authoring in other forms. The
            creation of the Version 2 schema explicitly maintains backward compatibility. The
            Version 1 knowledge document schema was structured such that the introduction of
            composite feature could not be made without breaking backward compatibility. As a
            result, internal organization of the schema was refactored to isolate the concept of a
            knowledge document and create two potential root references, which could be used
            depending on whether the KNART was a singleton or a composite. The Version 2 schema
            supports the composite structures, references, and direct inclusion of multiple
            knowledge documents. All the elements of the original document type are still
            supported.</para>

            <title>Overview of Integration Scenario</title>
            <para>This composite uses a simple integration scenario whereby the documentation
                template is first projected and based upon applicability information captured in
                that template, the order set is selectively activated. All orchestration is
                accomplished through embedded Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules in the
                composite.</para>

            <title>General Limitations</title>
            <para>The composite KNART is a machine-readable artifact comprised of independently
                validated components. The goal of the composition is not to add additional content
                but rather to orchestrate the individual components. The composite is not expected
                to be machine executable. The schema and functional environment in which the
                composite is created is based on an emerging standard and is not guaranteed to be
                compatible with the final balloted standard.</para>
            <section xml:id="section_wcy_b4v_ndb">
                <title>Format Limitation</title>
                <para>The proposed Health Level Seven International (HL7) KNART format for
                    composites is based on the original Knowledge Artifact Specification (KAS)
                    schema. The composite extension is specifically developed to allow the
                    composition of these singleton KAS artifacts into an organizing structure to
                    provide greater meaning. The composite KNART format is an emerging standard at
                    HL7 that allows heterogeneous artifacts to be grouped into one common organizing
                    document. In creating the composite knowledge artifacts, the individual
                    components of the composite have been limited to the existing KAS-derived
                    artifact types. As such, the abstraction of more advanced orchestration behavior
                    has been limited to the capabilities of that model.</para>

            <para>At an organizational level this composite is comprised of eight major entities.
                The first of these entities is the documentation template named
                CDSK_KRprt_CRDT_B36EP.xml. The other seven entities are order sets that are selected
                based on the consult request type. For the purposes of orchestration, the composite
                initially triggers an event that causes the documentation template to be activated.
                Upon the completion of the documentation template, the completion event is analyzed
                to determine which order set KNART to activate.</para>

                <title>Special Bindings</title>
                <para>The consult request documentation template did not specify a specific response
                    binding for the reason for consult. For the purposes of making the composite, it
                    is assumed that a default binding scenario is used. The standard binding is to
                    use the explicitly defined binding if present; if such a binding is not present,
                    then a default scheme is assumed. In the default scheme, if a
                    DocumentationConcept.identifier ID is present, then it will become the binding
                    symbol. Should there be no DocumentationConcept.identifier, then the binding is
                    based on the prompt used. The Name used for the binding is the prompt stripped
                    of all punctuation and white space. For example, if the documentation template
                    used the prompt โReason for consult:โ the result would be a symbolic name on
                    โReasonforconsult.โ If in creating a default symbolic name there is a conflict
                    in generated names, then that name will contain an array of the responses in the
                    order they appear in the template. It should be noted that scheme is not
                    expected to make it in to the standard, but rather the response binding is
                    expected to become a required element of a collect information action.</para>

            <para>In reviewing the structure and questions asked of the documentation template, it
                is not clear that all the elements required to fully create a referral are being
                asked. It is suggested that either a standardized referral documentation template be
                created and used for composites or that a detailed review of the documentation
                template for the additional required information be conducted prior to proceeding to
                an implementation phase. In addition, as noted earlier in the document, there are no
                meaningful response bindings in the documentation template. Analysis of the
                documentation template indicates that, while it checks for clinical stability, it
                does not control any behavior based on it, hence the composite does not
