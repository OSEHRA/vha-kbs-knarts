        <title>General Process</title>
        <para>In integrating and harmonizing the individual components of a composite knowledge
            artifact (KNART) the general process has been to rely on the inherent encapsulation
            properties envisioned in the new composite structure. Each individual knowledge artifact
            is presumed to be able to run in a standalone and independent manner. The composite
            artifact acts as a central orchestration agent, activating individual knowledge
            artifacts using an event driven model. Intercommunication between artifacts is handled
            solely through global shared state external to the composite and through the process of
            event payloads. Individual knowledge artifacts only communicate with the composite
            container.</para>
        <para>During the creation of the individual knowledge artifacts used in the formation of the
            composite their design and implementation explicitly envisioned their further
            integration into a composite structure. As such, minimal harmonization or communication
            is generally required. All composite KNARTs use references to the individual component
            knowledge artifacts rather than direct inclusion. The general design principles used
            should ensure that the overall composite does not alter the essential information
            contained in the components.</para>
        <para>The emerging composite KNART standard envisions that the parent composite will not
            restate the metadata included in its component parts unless there is a clinical or
            technical need to override or supplement the information contained in the components.
            This includes such elements such as supporting evidence, intended use, etc. Analysis of
            the components of this KNART did not find the need to make any overrides or supplements
            to the essential metadata.</para>
        <para>In developing the Version 2.0 KNART standard the work group has updated the essential
            file structure to support composites. The design approach of the workgroup was to define
            the composite mechanism to support composition the includes both literal inclusion and
            references to other knowledge artifact. The emerging standard explicitly envisions that
            composites may be of a heterogeneous nature and supports artifacts authoring in other
            forms. The creation of the version 2 schema explicitly maintains backward compatibility.
            The version 1.0 knowledge document schema was structured such that the introduction of
            composite feature could not be made without breaking backward compatibility. As a
            result, internal organization of the schema was refactored to isolate out the concept of
            a knowledge document and create two potential root references which could be used
            depending on if the KNART was a singleton or a composite. The version 2 schema superset
            of the prior schema - Which is to say that singletons follow the older schema
            (reorganized structurally) and the new composite document type supports the composite
            structures, references, and direct inclusion of multiple knowledge documents. All the
            elements of the original document type are still supported without breaking
            anything.</para>

            <title>Overview of Integration Scenario</title>
            <para>This composite uses a simple integration scenario whereby the documentation
                template is first projected and based upon applicability information captured in
                that template, the order set is selectively activated. All orchestration is
                accomplished through embedded Event Condition Action (ECA) Rules in the
                composite.</para>

            <title>General Limitations</title>
            <para>The composite KNART is a machine-readable artifact comprised of independently
                validated components. The goal of the composition is not to add additional content
                but rather to orchestrate the individual components. The composite is not expected
                to be machine executable. The schema and functional environment in which the
                composite is created is based on an emerging standard and is not guaranteed to be
                compatible with the final balloted standard.</para>
            <section xml:id="section_wcy_b4v_ndb">
                <title>Format Limitation</title>
                <para>The proposed Health Level 7 (HL7) KNART format for composites is based on the
                    original Knowledge Artifact Specification (KAS) schema. The composite extension
                    is specifically developed to allow the composition of these singleton KAS
                    artifacts into an organizing structure to provide greater meaning. The composite
                    KNART format is an emerging standard at HL7 that allows heterogeneous artifacts
                    to be grouped into one common organizing document. In creating the composite
                    knowledge artifacts, the individual components of the composite have been
                    limited to the existing KAS derived artifact types. As such the abstraction of
                    more advanced orchestration behavior has been limited to the capabilities of
                    that model.</para>

            <title>Organization</title>
            <para>At an organizational level this composite is comprised of eight major entities.
                The first of these entities is the documentation template named
                CDSK_KRprt_CRDTB36EP.xml. The other seven entities are the order sets that are
                selected based on the consult request type. For the purposes of orchestration, the
                composite initially triggers an event causing the documentation template to be
                activated. Upon the completion of the documentation template the completion event is
                analyzed to determine which order set knowledge artifact is activated.</para>

                <title>Special Bindings</title>
                <para>The consult request documentation template did not specify a specific response
                    binding for the reason for consult. For the purposes of making the composite it
                    is assumed that a default binding scenario is used. The standard binding is to
                    use the explicitly defined binding if present, if such a binding is not present
                    then a default scheme is assumed. In the default scheme, if an
                    DocumentationConcept.identifier id is present then this will become the binding
                    symbol. Should there be no DocumentationConcept.identifier then the binding is
                    based on the prompt used. The Name used for the binding is the prompt stripped
                    of all punctuation and white space. For example, in the case the Documentation
                    template used the prompt “Reason for consult:” which results in a symbolic name
                    on “Reasonforconsult”. If in creating a default symbol name there is a conflict
                    in generated names, then that name will contain an array of the responses in the
                    order they appear in the template. It should be noted that scheme is not
                    expected to make it in to the standard, but rather the response binding is
                    expected to become a required element of a Collect Information Action.</para>

                    <para>Review of the mappings indicates that exact match testing should work for
                        routing to the correct order set. Many of the cases resolve to order sets
                        designed to handle multiple reasons. The coding is looser then would be
                        strictly preferred with the “Pacemaker ICD Follow Up” not specified as
                        clearly as the other cases. Another coding exception is the “Other” case
                        which results in the reason code being null, it would be clearer if a
                        specific coding could be used.</para>

            <para>In reviewing the structure and questions asked of the documentation template it is
                not clear that all the elements required to fully create a referral are being asked.
                It is suggested that either a standardized referral documentation template be
                created and used for composites or that a detailed review of the documentation
                template for the additional required information be conducted prior to proceeding to
                an implementation phase. In addition, as noted earlier in the document, there are no
                meaningful response bindings in the documentation template. Analysis of the
                Documentation template indicates that while it checks for Clinical Stability it will
                does not gate any behavior based on it, hence the composite does not either.</para>
